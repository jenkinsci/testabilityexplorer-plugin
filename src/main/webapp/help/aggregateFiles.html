This option allows you to mark that different result files should be aggregated.
This will imply that the correct recalculation of the weighted average over the different
result files will happen, thus resulting in a correct overall score.
For the weighted average, a default weight, identical to the one of testability-explore,
 is used. You have however the ability to tweak you weight in the option below.
